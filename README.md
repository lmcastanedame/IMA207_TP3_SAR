# Signal Analysis and Pattern Recognition (IMA207)

This project is part of the IMA207 course, focusing on applying signal analysis techniques and pattern recognition methods using Python. The primary goal is to process and analyze signals using various mathematical tools and algorithms, including Fourier Transform, digital filtering, and classification techniques.

## Project Description

The project aims to develop a system that processes and analyzes signals in order to detect and classify patterns. Through this project, different signal processing techniques are explored, such as frequency domain transformations and filtering methods. The analysis includes both theoretical and practical approaches to signal processing.

## Project Structure

The repository includes the following files and directories:

- **main.py**: The main script where the signal processing algorithms are implemented and executed.
- **signals/**: A directory containing example signal data files used for testing and analysis.
- **utils.py**: Helper functions used for signal pre-processing and transformations.
- **notebooks/**: Jupyter notebooks for experimenting with different signal analysis techniques.
- **requirements.txt**: A file listing the Python dependencies required to run the project.
- **README.md**: This file, providing an overview of the project.
  
## How to Use

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Libraries: NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib

You can install the dependencies using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Running the Project

To analyze a signal and perform pattern recognition, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your signal data. You can place your signal files in the `signals/` directory or use the provided examples.
2. Run the main script to process the signal:

    ```bash
    python main.py
    ```

3. The output will display visual representations of the signal, including frequency domain analysis and classification results.

### Key Steps in the Process

1. **Load Signal**: The signal data is loaded from files in the `signals/` directory.
2. **Pre-process Signal**: Apply filtering techniques to remove noise and prepare the signal for analysis.
3. **Fourier Transform**: Transform the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain to identify key frequency components.
4. **Pattern Recognition**: Apply machine learning or rule-based classification to detect patterns within the signal.
5. **Results**: Visualize the filtered signal, the frequency spectrum, and any identified patterns.

## Purpose

The project serves as a foundation for understanding signal processing and pattern recognition techniques. It can be extended to more complex scenarios, such as audio signal classification, biomedical signal analysis, or any application where pattern detection in signals is required.
